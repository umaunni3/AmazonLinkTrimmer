# AmazonLinkTrimmer
A simple chrome extension that trims the tracking junk from the URL of whatever amazon product page you're looking at, and copies the trimmed URL to your browser with one click.

To use: download this whole repo and put the contents in a folder (see structure below). Then add it to your Chrome Extensions by going to chrome://extensions and enabling developer mode/tools/whatever, and clicking "load unpacked" and selecting the folder with this repo's contents in it. Then, in the top bar (next to your other existing extensions), click on the puzzle piece and then click on the pin icon next to this extension's name.
